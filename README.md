## Philosophy

Don't start from scratch. Find an open-source project, a template, an asset pack—anything that gives you a foundation—and build something Catholic from it. Fork it, extend it, reskin it.

What you make here becomes part of that same commons. Future jams build on your work. The body of Catholic games grows.
