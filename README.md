## About

Catholic Game Jam brings together developers, artists, musicians, writers, and designers to create games with Catholic themes. Whether you're building a platformer about saints, a puzzle game exploring the sacraments, or an RPG set in Church history—2,000 years of epic material awaits.

### Philosophy

Don't start from scratch. Find an open-source project, a template, an asset pack—anything that gives you a foundation—and build something Catholic from it. Fork it, extend it, reskin it.

What you make here becomes part of that same commons. Future jams build on your work. The body of Catholic games grows.

### Judging Criteria

Games are scored on three criteria (1-5 scale):

- **Catholic Integration** - Is the faith woven into gameplay, or just decoration?
- **Gameplay/Fun** - Is it enjoyable to play with clear goals and satisfying loops?
- **Polish/Completeness** - Does it feel finished and playable from start to end?
